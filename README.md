# PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast

### Problem Statement:
Effective energy management is crucial for households and energy providers. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for resource optimization, cost reduction, and effective demand planning. This project focuses on creating a machine learning model that leverages historical data to predict household energy usage.
### Data understanding and exploration:
Load the dataset
Check for null values and impute or drop them as necessary.
Identify and remove duplicates.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers.
### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing or inconsistent data points.
Parse date and time into separate features.
Create additional features such as daily averages, peak hours, or rolling averages.
Normalize or scale the data for better model performance.
### Feature Engineering:
Determine the most impactful features to effectively predict global active power consumption.
### Model selection and Training:
Split data into training and testing sets
Train models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Optimize performance through hyperparameter tuning.
### Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Compare results across models and identify the best-performing one.
